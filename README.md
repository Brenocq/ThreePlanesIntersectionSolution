# Solution of Intersection of Three Planes

This problem was proposed by Ali Tahzibi. The objective is show the solution of the intersection of three planes. First, I calculated the type of solution based on the three general equation (no solution/point/line/plane). After determining the type of solution I made some additional calculations to plot the solution.

### Types of solution

If the solution to this problem exists, it can be a point, a line, or a plane.
